# RDL and RelBench Project Repository

## Overview

This repository focuses on the integration and demonstration of Relational Deep Learning (RDL) techniques using RelBench for tabular prediction tasks. It includes the implementation of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that exploit the relational structure of data for improved predictive accuracy.

## Notebooks

### 1. GNN-Based Model Training for Tabular Prediction

This notebook demonstrates the process of training a GNN-based model using RelBench, a framework for relational data science. It includes data loading, model setup, training, and evaluation, highlighting the impact of relational structures on model performance.
