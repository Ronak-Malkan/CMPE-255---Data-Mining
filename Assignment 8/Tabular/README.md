# Tabular Project Repository

## Overview

This repository showcases the use of advanced models and techniques for handling tabular data. The primary focus is on demonstrating the capabilities of the Tabula model for generating synthetic data and performing inference using zero-shot techniques. These techniques can enhance machine learning workflows by providing expanded data for training and more flexible model usage without extensive retraining.

## Notebooks

### 1. Synthetic Data Generation with Tabula

This notebook demonstrates how to generate synthetic data that mimics the statistical properties of real datasets using the Tabula model. This is particularly useful for data augmentation and privacy-preserving data sharing.

### 2. Zero-Shot Inference with Tabula

Explore the capabilities of the Tabula model to perform inference without additional training. This method allows for quick adaptation to new tasks without the need for retraining the model on new datasets.
