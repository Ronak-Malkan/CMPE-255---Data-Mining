# Assignment 2: Auto Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This project employs automated exploratory data analysis to quickly gain insights into the Heart Disease UCI dataset from Kaggle using the Sweetviz library. The goal is to demonstrate the efficiency and depth of analysis achievable with auto EDA tools, which can be particularly useful for preliminary data assessment and decision-making in data-driven projects.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on the **Heart Disease UCI Dataset** available on Kaggle.

### Data Attributes

This dataset includes several medical attributes such as:

- Age: Age of the patient
- Sex: Sex of the patient
- CP (Chest Pain Type): Chest pain type ranging from 1 to 4
- Trestbps: Resting blood pressure
- Chol: Serum cholestoral in mg/dl
- Fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
- RestECG: Resting electrocardiographic results
- Thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exang: Exercise induced angina
- Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- CA: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
- Thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia
- Target: Diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)

## Objectives

The objectives of this assignment were to:

- Utilize Sweetviz, an auto EDA tool, to analyze the Heart Disease dataset.
- Generate a detailed report that provides insights into distributions, associations, and missing data within minutes.
- Compare the efficiency and comprehensiveness of Sweetviz against traditional manual exploratory data analysis methods.

## Analysis Performed

### Sweetviz Report Generation

Sweetviz was used to create a visual report that:

- Analyzes each feature including distributions and impact on the target variable.
- Provides a comparative view between different groups (e.g., patients with and without heart disease).
- Highlights correlations and associations between features.
- Detects and reports missing data which is crucial for pre-processing steps in predictive modeling.

The report generated by Sweetviz is comprehensive and includes visualizations for quicker interpretation of data characteristics and relationships.

### Insights Derived

Key insights derived from the Sweetviz analysis include:

- Identification of primary factors that correlate with the presence of heart disease.
- Analysis of patient demographics and their relationship to heart disease outcomes.
- Evaluation of data quality, highlighting fields with missing values or potential data entry errors.

## Tools Used

- **Sweetviz**: For generating the auto EDA report.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Google Colab**: As the development and execution environment.

## Conclusion

The Sweetviz library proved to be an invaluable tool for conducting quick and comprehensive exploratory data analysis. This assignment showcased how auto EDA tools can significantly reduce the time needed for data investigation, allowing for faster, data-informed decisions in the early stages of a project.

## How to Run

1. Open the Google Colab notebook provided in the `/notebooks` directory.
2. Ensure all libraries as listed in `requirements.txt` are installed.
3. Run the notebook to reproduce the Sweetviz report and view it by opening `Sweetviz_Report.html`.

For further details, refer to the Sweetviz report generated which provides a deeper dive into each variable and its impact on the dataset.
