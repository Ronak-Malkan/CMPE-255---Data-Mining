# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques in Data Mining

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive demonstration of various dimensionality reduction techniques applied to multiple datasets. The project showcases how different techniques can be utilized to reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving as much information as possible.

The techniques are applied to diverse datasets such as the Iris dataset, Digits dataset, and Olivetti Faces dataset, each chosen for their distinct characteristics and suitability for demonstrating specific methods.

## Dimensionality Reduction Techniques Demonstrated

### Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)

Ideal for datasets with nonlinear manifold structures, demonstrating how local neighborhoods can be linearly approximated to uncover global structures.

### t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

Highly effective for visualizing clusters in high-dimensional data. t-SNE excels at preserving local structure and revealing data groupings based on similarity.

### ISOMAP

Extends MDS by considering the global geometry of the data, calculated as geodesic distances on the data manifold, making it suitable for datasets with broadly distributed non-linear structures.

### UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)

Combines distance preservation of global structure with local data manifold learning, making it superior in speed and scalability compared to t-SNE, particularly for very large datasets.

### Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)

Focuses on distance preservation across the entire dataset, ideal for emphasizing dissimilarities in data and exploring the data's overall structure.

### PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and Variants

- **Standard PCA**: Provides a linear dimensionality reduction, which is quick and effective but may miss complex nonlinear relationships in data.
- **Incremental PCA**: Suitable for datasets that do not fit in memory, offering a batch-wise solution without sacrificing too much accuracy.
- **Kernel PCA**: Allows capturing nonlinear relationships, useful for complex datasets where traditional PCA falls short.

### Autoencoders

Learns to compress data into a lower-dimensional space and then reconstruct it back to its original form, effectively capturing both primary and subtle data characteristics.

## Implementation Using Databricks

The project also explores the use of Databricks, a unified platform for data analytics that simplifies working with large datasets and complex algorithms via Apache Spark. Key features include:

- **Setup**: Easy configuration of a scalable Databricks environment.
- **Execution**: Efficient running of PySpark code to perform dimensionality reduction on distributed data.
- **Visualization**: Use of Databricks' built-in graphing tools and external libraries for enhanced data visualization.

## Detailed Comparison of Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

Here's a comparison based on the application to the selected datasets:

- **Performance**: UMAP and t-SNE generally provide more insightful visualizations for complex datasets compared to linear methods like PCA, due to their ability to preserve local data structure.
- **Speed and Scalability**: PCA (including its variants) is typically faster and more scalable to larger datasets compared to t-SNE and ISOMAP. UMAP offers a good balance between speed and detail preservation.
- **Complexity Handling**: Kernel PCA and Autoencoders excel in datasets where non-linear relationships are significant, outperforming linear techniques.
- **Interpretability**: Standard PCA and MDS are more straightforward to interpret as they focus on variance and distance preservation, making them practical for initial explorations of data structure.

## Conclusion

The choice of dimensionality reduction technique can significantly influence the insights gained from data analysis. This project demonstrates both the technical implementation and the strategic considerations needed to select the most appropriate method based on the data characteristics and analytical goals.
