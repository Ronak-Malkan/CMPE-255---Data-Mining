# Iris Dataset Analysis Using SEMMA Methodology

This project demonstrates the application of the SEMMA methodology (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, and Assess) to the well-known Iris dataset. The goal was to classify iris species based on their morphological features with high accuracy using a structured data analysis approach.

## Project Overview

### Task Description

The task involved applying each phase of the SEMMA methodology to the Iris dataset:

- **Sample:** All samples from the dataset were used given its balanced nature, ensuring comprehensive analysis across all species.
- **Explore:** Extensive visual and statistical analyses were performed to understand feature relationships and class distributions.
- **Modify:** Data preprocessing included scaling features to standardize the dataset, preparing it for effective modeling.
- **Model:** A Random Forest Classifier was chosen for its robustness and was trained on an 80-20 split of the data.
- **Assess:** The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Results

The Random Forest model achieved 100% accuracy on the test set, successfully classifying all iris species. The results underscore the efficacy of the SEMMA methodology in guiding the data analysis process.

### Critique of Provided Code

The provided code effectively implemented the SEMMA methodology, demonstrating a clear structured approach to data analysis. Here are some specific observations and suggestions:

- **Exploration:** The visualizations (pair plots and box plots) effectively highlighted relationships and potential outliers. Including additional statistical summaries or tests could further enhance this phase.
- **Modification:** The application of `StandardScaler` was appropriate. Consideration of outlier treatment or feature engineering based on exploratory data analysis findings could provide improvements.
- **Model Assessment:** The use of a confusion matrix and classification report was apt for evaluating model performance. Expanding the assessment to include cross-validation or ROC curves would provide a more robust evaluation.

## Conclusion

The SEMMA methodology proved highly effective for structured data analysis in this project. The process facilitated a deep understanding of the dataset and led to the development of a highly accurate classification model. Future work could explore the application of SEMMA to more complex or larger datasets.
