# Enhancing Credit Card Fraud Detection Using KDD Methodology

## Overview

This project applies the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) methodology to the task of credit card fraud detection. Using a dataset from Kaggle, the project involves a comprehensive analysis cycle starting from data understanding to deployment of a predictive model. The goal is to enhance the predictive accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection through advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.

## Data

The dataset consists of credit card transactions that are labeled as fraudulent or genuine. Each transaction is represented by features obtained through a PCA transformation, ensuring the anonymity of the data. Key features include:

- V1 to V28: PCA transformed features
- Amount: Transaction amount
- Class: Indicates whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0)

## Methodology

The project follows these key phases of the KDD process:

1. **Data Understanding**: Exploring and assessing the nature of the dataset, its distribution, and its balance.
2. **Data Preparation**: Handling missing values, scaling the 'Amount' feature, and removing less informative features.
3. **Modeling**: Implementing a RandomForestClassifier to predict fraudulent transactions.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model based on precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

The initial model results indicated high accuracy but revealed some issues in recall for the fraudulent class, which are critical in the context of fraud detection. After optimization, the model showed improved performance:

- **Initial Model Accuracy**: High overall accuracy (99.9%)
- **Optimized Model Recall for Fraud Class**: Improved from 75% to 85%

## Critique of Initial Code

The initial code provided a solid foundation but had several areas for improvement:

- **Feature Engineering**: The 'Time' feature was prematurely dropped without assessing its potential predictive power.
- **Model Evaluation**: Initially focused primarily on accuracy, overlooking the significance of recall and precision, which are particularly vital in fraud detection.
- **Handling Imbalanced Data**: The initial approach did not adequately address the imbalance inherent in the dataset, which could lead to a model biased towards predicting non-fraudulent transactions.

## Improvements Made

- **Reintegrated 'Time' Feature**: Analyzed and tested the 'Time' feature for any predictive power it might hold.
- **Enhanced Model Evaluation**: Shifted focus to more relevant metrics such as recall and F1-score for the minority class.
- **Advanced Techniques for Imbalance**: Applied techniques like SMOTE and adjusted class weights in the RandomForest classifier to better handle the class imbalance.

## Conclusion

The application of the KDD methodology facilitated a structured and thorough analysis of the credit card fraud detection dataset. The iterative process of model tuning and feature reevaluation significantly enhanced the modelâ€™s ability to identify fraudulent transactions, thus improving the overall effectiveness of the fraud detection system.

## Future Work

Future enhancements will focus on exploring alternative machine learning algorithms, further tuning model parameters, and deploying the model in a simulated real-time environment to test its effectiveness in operational scenarios.
