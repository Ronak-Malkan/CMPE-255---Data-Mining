# Task 2

In task 2 we have to create a full stack application using AI pair Programming tool such as Github Copilot, or Clauddev.

I have chosen to use Github Copilot for the task.

I have made a Todo application for this task, which uses Node.js/Express.js as it's backend, React for the frontend, and SQLite for the database.

I have also used Jest for testing purpose.

I have created Loom videos which demonstrate the code and working application:
