# AE SemRL: Learning Semantic Association Rules with Autoencoders

## Overview

This repository contains the resources and documentation for the presentation on **AE SemRL: Learning Semantic Association Rules with Autoencoders**. AE SemRL is a novel framework that combines the power of autoencoders and semantic enrichment to address key challenges in Association Rule Mining (ARM). By leveraging semantic knowledge and deep learning, AE SemRL generates highly interpretable and scalable association rules, suitable for a variety of real-world applications.
