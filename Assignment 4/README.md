We also have to use GitHub Copilot/ Claudedev to create a full-stack application. We have to:

1. Write functions and code
2. Refactor code
3. Write unit tests
4. Write the entire app

I have chosen to use Github Copilot for the task.

I have made a Todo application for this task, which uses Node.js/Express.js as its backend, React for the frontend, and SQLite for the database.

I have also used Jest for testing purposes.

I have created Loom videos which demonstrate the code and working application:
